# RottenFruitDetection
<h3>Kean University SP24 Senior Capstone Project</h3> <br>

Project Members: Richard Angueira, Michael Banko, Christian Rasmussen, & Brian Weideli <br> <br>

<strong>Project Description:</strong> We are using images of fresh and rotten peaches, pomegranates, and strawberries to train machine learning models that determine if a picture of one of the respective fruits is rotten or fresh. We are also going to be creating a website application that links to our machine learning models which is going to allow anyone to upload images of the selected fruits which will then be sent to our models for classification. Once classification is finished, it will then return whether the fruit is rotten or fresh and how accurate the model is in its classification.<br> <br>

<strong>Project Purpose: </strong> The purpose of our project is to allow both producers (farmers) and consumers (customers) to determine whether a fruit is either fresh for harvest or whether a fruit is good for consumption. <br> <br>

<strong>Required Team Skills:</strong> The skills that are required in the team to complete this project will be experience with HTML, CSS, Flask, Ngrok, Python, Google Colab, Common Algorithms used for Machine Learning, and knowledge of the fruit of that we are testing in the model. <br> <br>
